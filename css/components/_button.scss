Developer's Note:

I didn't get to use the classes secondary-button and outlined-button but I left it here anyway incase you want to change some styles, Just add the classes on the button in the html and you're good to go.

The reason I was not able to use it is the buttons with different styles is in the WooCommerce pages which I have no access to the actual source code to be able to add these classes.
